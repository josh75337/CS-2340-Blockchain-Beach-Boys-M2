Bio:
Likes long walks on the beach. Wishes he could use Emacs to edit files and have Android studio
actually acknowledge indentation (notice me senpai!)

Likes anime. Sort of. Sometimes.

Life goals:

1. Teach android studio that it actually isn't smarter than me (at least for some stuff)

2. Complete all "official" mission packs of the original Quake videogame (2/3, still need to finish
Dimensions of the Past)

3. Get this project to actually compile and pass tests

I'm a simple man. I don't ask for too many things in life, but I guarantee that Android Studio (TM)
will destroy at least some of my dreams.
